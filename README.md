### Introduction to the Data
The original assignment from Kaggle:
"You are provided hourly rental data spanning two years. For this competition, the training set is comprised of the first 19 days of each month, while the test set is the 20th to the end of the month. You must predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour by the test set, using only information available prior to the rental period."

The `bikeshare` data set includes 10886 hourly periods that occurred between  January 2011 and January 2013 in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, DC. Each hourly period contains a summary of environmental information during that hour including the weather and temperature, as well as information about the type of users making the rentals, and the features of the time of year when the hourly period occurred. 


### The Scripts
This project feautures a RMarkdown document produced in RStudio and knitted to HTML. Please view the .html, .Rmd, or .md file for an overview of both the assignment questions and my responses.
